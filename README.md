🔸 Mapping the Shift in U.S. Home Values (2020–2025) 🔸

▪️ Built a quarterly time-lapse using Zillow’s ZHVI to show how typical single-family home values changed across all 48 contiguous states.
▪️ Each frame = one quarter. You can visually trace the rise, plateau, and current state of the housing market.
▪️ Color scale remains fixed throughout—no visual tricks, just real price evolution.
▪️ The final frame (May 2025) offers a sharp look at where prices are now post-pandemic.

▪️ Top 5 States by Home Value (May 2025)
  1. California — $811K
  2. Massachusetts — $640K
  3. Washington — $607K
  4. Colorado — $558K
  5. New Jersey — $537K

This is what long-form trends look like when raw data meets thoughtful design.
